## Project Overview

Emotions play a crucial role in human communication, and recognizing these emotions can significantly enhance interactive systems. The Face Emotion Recognition System aims to provide a robust method to detect and classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. This project demonstrates how to:

- **Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Using a dataset of facial images annotated with different emotions.
- **Deploy the Model for Real-Time Detection**: Process live video feeds to detect and label facial emotions instantly.

## Features

- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Capture and analyze frames from a webcam feed to identify emotions in real-time.
- **Model Training**: Train your custom model with a labeled dataset to recognize various facial expressions.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified steps to install and run the system, even for beginners in machine learning and computer vision.

## File Descriptions

- **`realtimedetection.py`**: The core script for real-time emotion detection. It uses the trained model to analyze frames from a live webcam feed and annotate detected emotions on the faces.
- **`trainmodel.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that guides you through the process of training a face emotion recognition model. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture setup, training, and evaluation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python libraries and packages required to run the project. This file ensures that you have all the necessary dependencies installed.

## Installation

To set up the Face Emotion Recognition System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine using Git.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aviralnagarcodex/FaceEmotionRecognition.git
    cd face-emotion-recognition
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install the dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running Real-Time Emotion Detection

Before running the detection script, make sure your webcam is connected and properly configured. To start detecting emotions in real-time, execute the following command:

```bash
python realtimedetection.py
```

This script will open a window showing the live webcam feed with detected faces and their corresponding emotional labels.

### Training the Emotion Recognition Model

If you want to train your own model, open the `trainmodel.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `trainmodel.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface and follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook. This includes loading and preprocessing your dataset, defining the model architecture, and training the model.

## Learning Journey

This project is part of my ongoing exploration into machine learning and computer vision. I have been leveraging various educational platforms to build my skills, including:

- **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)**: For in-depth courses on machine learning and neural networks.
- **[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)**: For practical, project-based learning in AI and computer vision.
- **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)**: For hands-on experience with datasets and machine learning competitions.
- **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)**: For tutorials and walkthroughs that help in understanding complex concepts and practical implementations.

I am continuously learning and applying new techniques to improve this system and broaden my expertise.
